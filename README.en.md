# About Me

Hi! My name is Nikita, and I am a beginner coder and designer from Russia. And this is my first repository!

I want to start getting into creating plugins for **PMMP 5** (PocketMine-MP) and other projects in the field of game programming. In the future, I plan to develop my skills and work on larger-scale projects. I am also an experienced specialist in the field of design, having completed large-scale orders! Now I want to start working on plugins and share them with you!

### What I do:
- Engage in design development.
- Work on large orders in the design field.
- Study new technologies and frameworks related to PHP and game development.

Switch language:
- [Русский](README.md)
